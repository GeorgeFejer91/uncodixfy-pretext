# Pretext text geometry for HTML UI

Read this when implementing the required Pretext path from `SKILL.md`. The API and caveats below were checked against upstream `@chenglou/pretext` 0.0.9 on 2026-09-24. Pin the version used by each project and recheck the [README](https://github.com/chenglou/pretext), [changelog](https://github.com/chenglou/pretext/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), and [platform bug ledger](https://github.com/chenglou/pretext/blob/main/PLATFORM_BUGS.md) before upgrades.

## Match the painted text

Use a named primary font that is actually loaded on every claimed target. Wait for `document.fonts.load()` or `document.fonts.ready` before preparing text; avoid measuring a fallback and painting another face. Set `<html lang>`, and prepare again when locale, text, face, weight, style, size, letter spacing, whitespace, or word-break mode changes. Resolve CSS `rem`/`em` sizes to CSS pixels. Prefer whole-pixel sizes where browser parity matters.

Keep measured regions within Pretext's supported model: `white-space: normal` or `pre-wrap`, `word-break: normal` or `keep-all`, `overflow-wrap: break-word`, and `line-break: auto`. Pass numeric pixel letter spacing and a definite pixel line height. It does not separately model optical sizing, arbitrary variation features, automatic hyphenation, nested inline DOM, custom kerning/word spacing, Flex/Grid sizing, padding, or SVG/icon width. `system-ui` and `-apple-system` have known Canvas-versus-DOM differences on macOS. A component requiring unsupported text CSS stays browser-verified, without a Pretext accuracy claim.

The runtime needs `Intl.Segmenter`, Canvas 2D measurement, and Unicode property escapes. Bundle the package locally in Tauri and offline sites. If a required capability or font is absent, show a readable CSS/DOM fallback and flag measurement as unavailable; do not silently mark text as fitted.

## Choose the smallest relevant API

| Need | API | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Predict paragraph, row, or card height at a known width | `prepare()` then `layout()` | Cache preparation by text and typography; recompute layout on width change. |
| Fit a single-line control | `prepareWithSegments()` then `measureNaturalWidth()` | Compare with the actual inner width after icons, gaps, insets, and borders. Also check line height against inner height. |
| Check a bounded multiline region | `prepareWithSegments()` then `measureLineStats()` | Compare `lineCount`, `maxLineWidth`, and `lineCount * lineHeight` with the region budget. |
| Get actual line text | `layoutWithLines()` | Use only when line materialization is needed. |
| Find a tighter multiline width | `walkLineRanges()` or `measureLineStats()` | Search widths while preserving the accepted line count, as in the official bubbles demo. |
| Route text beside media/plots | `layoutNextLineRange()` | Give each line its available width; use only when CSS flow cannot express the design. |
| Predict flat inline runs and atomic chips | `@chenglou/pretext/rich-inline` | Use its documented flat items and `extraWidth`; it is not an HTML renderer. |

For a one-line text button, the fit contract is:

```ts
import { measureNaturalWidth, prepareWithSegments } from '@chenglou/pretext'

const prepared = prepareWithSegments(label, canvasFont, { letterSpacing: letterSpacingPx })
const fits = measureNaturalWidth(prepared) <= innerTextWidthPx - safetyMarginPx
  && lineHeightPx <= innerTextHeightPx - safetyMarginPx
```

Compute `innerTextWidthPx` from the region's content box, subtracting the icon and group gap. Do not compare the label with the whole button width. With multiline text, call `measureLineStats(prepared, innerTextWidthPx)` and compare the resulting line count and widest line plus line-height budget. Empty strings return zero Pretext lines while an empty DOM block may still occupy one CSS line; account for that when sizing a container.

Pretext does not choose a font size by itself. First try the preferred readable token. If it fails, grow or reflow the region. If a bounded design truly needs type fitting, test a small approved size range, never below the readable minimum, and return an explicit no-fit result when the minimum still fails. If truncation is approved for secondary text, cut at grapheme boundaries with `Intl.Segmenter` or Pretext cursors; `Array.from(text)` splits code points, not all grapheme clusters. Keep the full text reachable by keyboard, touch, and assistive technology.

## Resize and verification

Use known Grid/Flex geometry or a batched `ResizeObserver` result for width changes. Run `prepare()` once per text/style/locale; on width-only resize rerun `layout()` or line stats. Avoid repeatedly reading `clientWidth` or computed style interleaved with writes. A changed candidate font size needs a fresh preparation. Limit caches when many dynamic strings or fonts cycle through the UI.

After exact fonts load, compare Pretext's prediction with a rendered DOM sample at the smallest and largest supported boxes, breakpoints, 200% zoom, long labels, empty text, unbroken IDs/URLs, emoji/combining sequences, CJK, RTL, and supported translations. Check the *page* as well as the text element: `scrollWidth > clientWidth` or `scrollHeight > clientHeight` in a region that should not scroll is a failure. Test the actual Tauri WebView on each claimed OS; desktop Chromium alone does not qualify WebKitGTK or WKWebView. Preserve an explicit safety margin for rounding and platform differences, and investigate any prediction/DOM mismatch rather than masking it with CSS clipping.

## Official examples and limits

- [Demos index](https://chenglou.me/pretext/): accordion height, chat virtualization, masonry cards, rich text, and obstacle-aware layout.
- [Bubbles demo](https://chenglou.me/pretext/bubbles/): find the tightest multiline width that keeps the same line count.
- [Dynamic layout source](https://github.com/chenglou/pretext/blob/main/pages/demos/dynamic-layout.ts): repeated title-size trials and variable-width lines around obstacles.
- [Research log](https://github.com/chenglou/pretext/blob/main/RESEARCH.md): why preparation and arithmetic layout are split, and known font behavior.
- [README caveats](https://github.com/chenglou/pretext#caveats): supported CSS subset, locale/font pitfalls, and runtime requirements.

The upstream demos establish possible uses, not proof that an application's fonts, strings, breakpoints, or WebViews fit. Those must pass the local rendered check.
